# Library #

An exercise from [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library?ref=lnav)
which required building a simple library app using basic Javascript. The main takeaways from the exercise 
involved manipulating the DOM and writing the appropriate logic.

A user can add a book along with its information, toggle its read status, and delete the book as well.
